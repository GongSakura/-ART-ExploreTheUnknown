# Interaction Statement

The whole interaction will go with a story telling mode.
There are five parts of the interaction:
1. viewers will watch a short animation which like a history documentary, let  viewers know there are some people in the world who have the courage to explore the unknown, and got a huge achievement. Then tell viewers the life is also full with unknown, and invite them to take an exploration of how their attitude toward lives on three aspects: love, wealth, and power.
2. viewers try to express themselve to their lover. viewers type some romantic sentences or words, the music will show up and will generative an art work based on what the viewer input. viewer can also move their mouse to follow the music, and the generated art work also will show the rhythm.
3. viewers draw their wealth on the screen, and it will also generate an art work via perlin noise, it will let the viewer can try their best to cost("draw") the least to gain the most
4. viewers speak to their mic to show their eager to the power, and the program will capture the volume and the frequency to generate an art work in real-time.
5. viewers look at the mirror which is a camera capture, then viewsrs can click a button called "reflection", then the viewer will be be wearing an African mask which is quite funny, then viewers can shake their head by following the music. in the process, it uses the "mediapipe" that is a face recognition API to trace the human face, so that I can locate the viewers face.

For the 2-4 parts, I devote to create some abstract art illustrations with my carefully chosen colors, I hope my aesthetic can bring the viewers the visual feast.
